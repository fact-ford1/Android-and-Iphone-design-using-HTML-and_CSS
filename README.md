This project is an ANDROID and IPHONE design which I called it 'Android and Iphone Model' which I design it using HTML and CSS. The Android Model is a mimic model of the TECNO POP 8 design with some apps on it which when clicked will lead you to some of the individual application official site, and some will also lead you to some appropriate site that helpd you to see what that app does especially the camera side will lead to some site that help test your webcam especially a laptop webcam or PC. I made the models rotate, i was experimenting on some lively design and i think it's quiet good. And the reason behind my Project was to display a product on site if this was to be used by E-Commence company or any online stores
